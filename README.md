## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification
- Logistic Regression – [Logistic Regression Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/LogisticRegression)
- Decision Trees – [Decision Tree Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/DecisionTreeClassifier)
- Random Forest – [Random Forest Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/RandomForest)
- Naive Bayes – [Naive Bayes Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/NaiveBayes)
- Gradient Boosting – [Gradient Boosting Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/GradientBoosting)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) – [KNN Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/KNN)

### 2. Regression
- Linear Regression – [Linear Regression Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/LinearRegression)
- Support Vector Regressor - [SVR Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/SupportVectorRegressor)

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.

### 1. Clustering
- DBSCAN – [DBSCAN Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/DBScan)
- Hierarchical Clustering – [Hierarchical Clustering Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/HierarchicalClustering)
- K-Means – [K-Means Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/Kmeans)



### 2. Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – [PCA Repo](https://github.com/harshini202005/PCA)
